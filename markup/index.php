						<h3>What is omnichanel?</h3>
						Welcome to the age of the consumer, where
						the player is the boss. Acquiring your customers, keeping them happy and meeting their expectations
						is harder than ever before. They expect and demand your products and services to be available
						whenever and wherever they want them to be. Players DO NOT think in terms of channels, they simply
						think of how quickly and easily they can do something.<br><br>
						 
						An omni-channel solution is not about the convergence of online and landbased gaming channels or
						having cross device content. It is about having one view of your customer and delivering them with
						the ability to have one account and one balance so that they are always switched on and engaged with
						your products.<br><br>
						 
						An omni-channel solution allows you to understand your customers and build a meaningful,
						long-lasting relationship with them. This relationship will enable you to deliver a personalised and
						tailored experience with them that will enable you to increase lifetime player values and increase
						retention rates.
					</div>
					<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="profile">
						<h3>Solutions</h3>
						A true omni-channel solution needs to be multi-channel at its core.  The OpenBet platform has been
						built to be multi-channel from day one and with our omni channel gaming solutions we can now take
						the Platform and the customer account into land-based premises and devices.<br><br>

						But just offering an omni-channel set of solutions isn't enough: in today's highly competitive and
						commoditised market you also need to be able to differentiate yourself and your brand. With
						OpenBet's solutions you can choose the products you want, from the suppliers you want, and you
						remain in control of your branding, portfolio and customer experience - across all channels - and
						retain a 360-degree view of all activity.<br><br>

						<h3>Web</h3>

						The web is a demanding market-place with high expectations: 24/7, multiple platforms and devices and
						your premier offering. OpenBet’s solutions can serve all product verticals, all devices, scale to
						meet the demands of the largest operators and keep you in control of the experience.<br><br>

						<h3>Mobile & Tablett</h3>
						OpenBet’s rich APIs and active partner programme gives you the power to offer innovative solutions
						on top of the world’s best sportsbook and content-rich casino. Deliver the full power of your
						platform and reach your players anytime and anywhere.<br><br>

						<h3>Betting Shop / Casino</h3>
						Bring your online customers into your land-based premises - or take your land-based customers
						online. With the OpenBet omnichannel solution a contactless payment card links their land-based
						activity back to the One Account and their single balance. Seamless, convenient entertainment for
						them and a complete 360-degree view for you.

						One Account for your customers’ ease of access and One Account for you for a 360-degree view of
						their activity.
						<a class="more_info" href="#">More info</a>

						<h4>Unify</h4>
						One Account. Endless Possibilities<br>
						Until now, the missing part of the omni-channel solution was connecting your land-based premises
						with your online account. OpenBet’s Unify solution answers this need by giving your customers a
						contactless payment card linked to an online account. The open framework allows any device
						manufacturer to integrate their cabinets, tills and POS solutions so your entire land-based offering
						can become cashless and seamlessly interact with your central customer account - it doesn’t even
						need to be OpenBet’s.<br><br>

						Multi-channel customers have proven to be 38% more profitable than single channel customers - don’t
						miss out on this incremental revenue stream, Unify your channels today!
						<a class="more_info" href="#">More info</a>

						<h4>UBet</h4>
						Self-Serve Betting<br>
						UBet uses the power of Unify and tablet computing to bring the OpenBet Sportsbook into your
						land-based premises. UBet seamlessly connecting the multi-channel account through the Unify card
						with the multi-channel Sportsbook and all the power and features that it offers - including the
						world’s most powerful live betting solution.<br><br>
						UBet is built on top of the OpenBet SiteBuilder content management system which means that you are
						in control of the full customer experience. Using responsive design you can even extend UBet to
						customers’ personal devices in your premises.

						<h4>Promote</h4>
						Gaming is all about entertainment and land-based gaming needs a compelling set of screens to bring
						the action and opportunities to your customers. OpenBet’s Promote system is a high impact betting,
						gaming and marketing display solution that provides a dynamic canvas to deliver a truly engaging
						experience in sportsbars, casinos, betting shop and lottery retail environments.<br><br>
						Able to display live broadcasts from satellite, cable and terrestrial TV and seamlessly combine it
						with overlays of betting opportunities and other marketing campaigns, OpenBet Promote can drive a
						wide range of display equipment and sizes. With the right content, you can increase footfall and
						premise dwell-time - and, ultimately, increase your consumer spend.

						<h4>UPlay</h4>
						Self-Serve Gaming<br>
						Gaming in a land-based environment today consists of large, bulky and expensive cabinets that take
						up valuable floor space and need to be a destination in themselves. OpenBet’s UPlay uses the
						convenience and power of Unify to bring gaming on a tablet to anywhere in your premises: in the
						lounge, at the bar, in the queue for the cashier - the small footprint and low cost of tablet
						computing means they can go anywhere.<br><br>
						UPlay is built on OpenBet’s Casino and carries the same rich content set that you can offer on your
						web and mobile solutions. Through the SiteBuilder content management system you can control the user
						experience, tailoring it to your premises’ branding.
